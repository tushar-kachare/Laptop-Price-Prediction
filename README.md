# Laptop Price Prediction

This project is a **machine learning-based web application** that predicts the price of a laptop based on its various features such as brand, processor type, RAM, storage capacity, screen resolution, and other specifications.

## Key Features

- **User-friendly interface:** Built with Streamlit, the app allows users to input laptop features through dropdown menus and other input widgets.
- **Accurate price prediction:** Utilizes a trained regression pipeline that includes data preprocessing and a predictive model to estimate realistic laptop prices.
- **Data-driven insights:** Handles categorical and numerical features appropriately with encoding and scaling techniques.
- **Model persistence:** Uses pickle to save and load the trained model and preprocessing pipeline efficiently.
- **End-to-end deployment:** The app is fully deployed on Streamlit Community Cloud, enabling easy access and use by anyone with a browser.

## Technologies Used

- Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, xgboost)
- Streamlit for interactive web UI
- Data preprocessing (encoding, scaling)
- Model training and evaluation (regression)
- Model serialization with pickle
- Version control with Git and GitHub
- Deployment on Streamlit Community Cloud
